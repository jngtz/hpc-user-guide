# Introduction {#intro}

Welcome to the user manual of the High-Performance-Server (HPC) of the GIScience group (University Jena).

It is tailored towards R processing.
This document describes how to get started and submit jobs to the cluster.

**A short introduction to HPCs**

The big advantage of a HPC is that users can submit jobs to ONE machine which then distributes the work across multiple machines in the background.
Incoming processing requests (jobs) are handled by the scheduler (SLURM), taking away the work of queuing the job and the potential issue of clashing into jobs from other users.

Administration is simplified by provisioning all computing nodes with the same virtual image.
This way, maintenance tasks are reduced and differences between the machines are avoided.
Administration is further simplified by using the [Spack](https://spack.io) package manager as this application allows for version-agnostic environment module installations.

The `$HOME` directory of every user is shared across all nodes, avoiding the need to keep data and scripts in sync across multiple machines.

**Before you start**:

- Working on a Linux server naturally requires a certain amount of familiarity with UNIX command-line shells and text editors.
There are dozens of Linux online tutorials which should help to get you started.^[For example, https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/.]
Of course, there are also great books on how to use Linux such as @shotts_linux_2012, @sobell_practical_2010 and @ward_how_2015 all of which are freely available.
If you still get stuck, Google might help you.

- Please add a SSH key pair to your account to be able to log in to the server without having to type your password.
This is especially useful since your password will consist of many letters and numbers (> 10) which you do not want to memorize.
See [this](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) guide if you have never worked with SSH keys before.
If you already use a SSH key pair on your machine, you can use `ssh-copy-id <username>@141.35.158.107` to copy your key to the server.
Afterwards you should be able to login via `ssh <username>@141.35.158.107` without being prompted for your password.

## Web Address

https://edi.geogr.uni-jena.de

IP: 141.35.158.107

## Hardware

The cluster consists of the following machines:

Group "**threadripper**":

- CPU: AMD Threadripper 2950X, 16-core, Hyperthreading support, 3.5 GHz - 4.4 GHz
- RAM: 126 GB DDR4 
- Number of nodes: 4 c[0-2] (+ frontend)
- The "frontend" is only operating on 12 cores with 100 GB RAM

Group "**opteron**":

- CPU: AMD Opteron 6172, 48 cores, no Hyperthreading, 2.1 GHz
- RAM: 252 GB DDR3 (c5 only comes with 130 GB RAM)
- Number of nodes: 
  - 2 (c[3-4])
  - 1 (c5)

The groups are reflected in the scheduler via the "partition" setting.

Group "threadripper" is about 3.5x faster than group "opteron".

## Software

The HPC was built following the installation guide provided by the [Open HPC](https://openhpc.community/) community (using the "Warewulf + Slurm" edition) and operates on a CentOS 7 base.
The scheduler that is used for queuing processing job requests is [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).
Load monitoring is performed via [Ganglia](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/). 
A live view is accessible [here](http://edi.geogr.uni-jena.de/ganglia/?r=hour&cs=&ce=&m=load_one&s=by+name&c=&tab=m&vn=&hide-hf=false).
[Spack](https://spack.io/) is used as the package manager.
More detailed instructions on the scheduler and the package manager can be found in their respective chapters.

## Data storage

The _mars_ data server is mounted at `/home` and stores all the data.
Currently we have a capacity of 20 TB for all users combined.
Data can be stored directly under your `/home` directory.

## Accessing files from your local computer

It is recommended to mount the server via `sshfs` to your local machine.
Transfer speed ranges between 50 - 100 Mbit/s when you're in the office so you should be able to access files without a delay.
Accessing files from outside will be slower.

If you really run in trouble with transfer speed, you could directly connect to the _mars_ server.

Otherwise, the route is as follows: `<local> (sshfs) -> edi (nfs) -> mars`

### Unix

For Unix system, the following command can be used

```sh
sudo sshfs -o reconnect,idmap=user,transform_symlinks,identityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa,allow_other,cache=yes,kernel_cache,compression=no,default_permissions,uid=1000,gid=100,umask=0 <username>@141.35.158.107:/ <local-directory>
```

The mount process is passwordless if you do it via SSH (i.e. via your `~/.ssh/id_rsa` key).
Note that the mount is actually performed by the root user, so you need to copy your SSH key to the root user: `cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa /root/.ssh/id_rsa`.

For convenience you can create an executable script that performs this action every time you need it.

```{block, type='rmdcaution'}
Auto-mount during boot via `fstab` is not recommended since sometimes the network is not yet up when the mount is executed.
This applies especially if you are not in the office but accessing the server from outside.
```

### Windows

Please install [sshfs-win](https://github.com/billziss-gh/sshfs-win) and follow the instructions. 

Note that this location (e.g., jason@141.35.158.107, or "jason@141.35.158.107 (\\sshfs) (Y:)" as seen in your windows explorer once mounted) is your home directory on mars that you will work from using the servers. Here you can create a folder structure for your data, scripts etc...

## Sharing of Results

### `workflowr`

Take a look at the R package [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html) which allows automatic deployment of R Notebooks.

### Local web server

The _Jupiter_ server (141.35.159.87) is set up as a web-server.
This means it is able to render HTML contents and list files in a directory listing.

_Jupiter_ is mounted to the cluster at `/mnt/nfs/jupiter`.
To use the functionality, you simply need to copy your desired files to `/home/www/<folder>` on Jupiter.
To do so, please follow these steps:

1. Request an account on Jupiter from Andreas
1. Login to _Jupiter_ and create the desired folders.
    The public URL relates as follows to the local directory:

    `https://jupiter.geogr.uni-jena.de/<folder>` -> `/home/www/<folder>` 
1. Copy your files from the cluster to the desired location on _Jupiter_ using the following code

    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    rsync -rlptDvzog --chown=www-data:www-data --fake-super \
      /mnt/nfs/jupiter/<path-to-your-file> \
      -e ssh <username>@jupiter.geogr.uni-jena.de:/home/www/<path-to-directory>
    ```

    This code will only copy files that have changed when being compared to the last execution so you can safely automate the call into your workflow.
    
Since all these contents will be available to everyone, you want to add a README.md file to your directory listing as well as an Impressum.
Even though no one usually knows this URL by default, be careful about sharing sensible files.

See https://jupiter.geogr.uni-jena.de/life-healthy-forest/ for an example.
You can request this theme from Andreas.
